# CLIMaCCF Library

      
## What is CLIMaCCF?

The Python Library CLIMaCCF is a software package developed by UC3M and DLR. The main idea of CLIMaCCF is to provide an open-source, easy-to-use, and flexible software tool that efficiently calculates spatially and temporally resolved climate impact of aviation emissions by using algorithmic climate change functions (aCCFs). The individual aCCFs of water vapour, NOx-induced ozone and methane, and contrail-cirrus and also merged aCCFs that combine the individual aCCFs can be calculated.

**License:** CLIMaCCF is released under GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPLv3).

## How to run the library
The installation is the first step to working with CLIMaCCF. In the following, the steps required to install the library are provided.

0. It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment (e.g., env_climaccf)  with Python versions >= 3.10:
```python
conda create -n env_climaccf python==3.10
```
1. Clone or download the repository. The CLIMaCCF source code is available on a public GitHub repository: https://github.com/dlr-pa/climaccf.git. The easiest way to obtain it is to clone the repository using git: git clone https://github.com/dlr-pa/climaccf.git. Then, Locate yourself in the CLIMaCCF (library folder) path, and run the following line, using terminal (MacOS and Linux) or cmd (Windows), which will install all dependencies:
```python
pip install -e . 
```
or directly use: pip install git+https://github.com/dlr-pa/climaccf.git 

2. The installation package contains a set of sample data and an example script for testing purposes. To run it at the library folder, enter the following command:
```python
pytest
```
The library runs successfully if env_processed.nc is generated at the library folder/test/sample_data/. One can visualize the file using a visualization tool.

## How to use it

1. import library:

```python
import climaccf
from climaccf.main_processing import ClimateImpact
```

2. Specify two datasets, separating data provided at each pressure level and surface variables, typically collected in different datasets:
```python
input_dir = {}

# Input data provided at pressure levels such as temperature, geopotential and relative humidity:
input_dir['path_pl']  = dir_pressure_variables  

#Input data provided in single pressure level such as top net thermal radiation at the TOA: 
input_dir['path_sur'] =  dir_surface_variables  
```

3. Specify the directory where all outputs will be written:
```python
output_dir = dir_results 
```    
    
4. (Optional) The scope of CLIMaCCF is to provide individual and merged aCCFs as spatially and temporally resolved information considering meteorology from the actual synoptical situation, the aircraft type, the selected physical climate metric, and the selected version of prototype algorithms in individual aCCFs. Consequently, some user-preferred settings need to be defined. The easiest (and user-friendliest, less error-prone) way is to use a configuration file. In CLIMaCCF, the configuration settings are included in a YAML file and named *config-user.yml*. YAML is a human-friendly markup language and is commonly used for configuration files. In the following, a sample configuration file located in the CLIMaCCF folder is provided:

# If true, standard deviation of aCCFs and meteorological variables are saved in the output file

      # Options: true, false
```
One can load the configurations in the main script using:

```python
with open("config-user.yml", "r") as ymlfile: confg = yaml.load(ymlfile)
```    
Now, the configuration settings are included in a dictionary called *confg*. One can directly define configuration settings in a dictionary. Notice that default values for the settings have been defined within the library database; thus, defining dictionary *confg* is optional and, if included, overwrites the default ones.

5. Run the library to produce outputs:

After defining configurations and input and output directories, CLIMaCCF is prepared to calculate individual and merged aCCFs. First, the input meteorological variables will be processed. This processing step is mainly related to 1) extracting variables of input data, 2) calculating required variables from alternative ones in case of missing variables (for details, see Table 5 of Dietmüller et al. 2022, 3) unifying the naming and dimension of variables, and 4) changing the resolution and geographical area. 
The horizontal resolution and the geographical region of the output can be selected in the user configuration file (config-user.yml). Notice that the horizontal resolution cannot be higher than the resolution of the meteorological input data, and the decrease in resolution is a factor i of natural numbers.

```python
CI = ClimateImpact(input_dir, output_dir, **confg)
```
Second, after processing the weather data, aCCFs are calculated, taking into account the user-defined configuration settings in *config-user.yml*. 

```python
CI.calculate_accfs(**confg)
```
Third, an output file (either in netCDF or PICKLE file formats) will be generated. The output file contains different variables depending on the selected user configurations. 
For instance, the output file contains both individual and merged aCCFs if, in *config-user.yml*, one selects **merged: true**. The dimension of output variables for the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) data products is *time*, *member*, *pressure level*, *latitude*, and *longitude* (i.e., 5D array), and for the deterministic ones, *time*, *pressure level*, *latitude*, and *longitude* (i.e., 4D array).
The generated netCDF file (if selected) is compatible with well-known visualization tools such as ferret, NCO, and Panoply.
In addition to the netCDF (or PICKLE), the user can choose the GeoJSON format for storing polygons of climate sensitive regions
(i.e., climate hotspots). If one selects: **merged: true**, **Chotspots: true**, some GeoJson files (number: pressure levels * number of time) will be generated in the specified output directory. 


## Testing CLIMaCCF

Here we provide an example configuration script together with some provided ERA5 sample data (retrieved from the Copernicus Climate Data Store: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/, European Reanalysis 5, 2020)). In order to test CLIMaCCF on your system and to test if the output is generated correctly, we recommend running CLIMaCCF using the example provided in the following. 

First of all, define the configurations in a YAML file format (e.g., config-user.yml) as:

```python
# Configuration of the calculation of algorithmic climate change functions (aCCFs) #

efficacy: true              
efficacy-option: lee_2021 
aCCF-V: V1.0
aCCF-scalingF:
    CH4: 1
    CO2: 1
    Cont.: 1
    H2O: 1
    O3: 1
climate_indicator: ATR
emission_scenario: future_scenario
TimeHorizon: 20
PCFA: PCFA-ISSR
PCFA-ISSR:
    rhi_threshold: 0.9
temp_threshold: 235
PCFA-SAC:
    EI_H2O: 1.25
    Q: 43000000.0
    eta: 0.3

# Technical specifications of aircraft/engine dependent parameters #

NOx_EI&F_km: TTV
ac_type: wide-body
        
# Specifies the saved output file #

PMO: true
NOx_aCCF: false
unit_K/kg(fuel): false
merged: true
Chotspots: false
Chotspots_calc_method: dynamic
Chotspots_calc_method_cons: 1e-13
Chotspots_calc_method_dynm:
    hotspots_percentile: 95
    latitude: false 
    longitude: false
hotspots_binary: true
MET_variables: false
geojson: true
color: copper
horizontal_resolution: 0.5
lat_bound: false
lon_bound: false
save_format: netCDF

# Specifies output for statistical analysis, if ensemble prediction system (EPS) data products are used #

mean: false
std: false
```
Then, by running the following script:

```python
import climaccf
from climaccf.main_processing import ClimateImpact

path_here = 'climaccf/'
test_path = path_here + '/test/sample_data/'
input_dir = {'path_pl': test_path + 'pressure_lev_june2018_res0.5.nc', 'path_sur': test_path + 'surface_june2018_res0.5.nc', 'path_lib': path_here}
output_dir = test_path + 'env_processed.nc'

""" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LOAD CONFIGURATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% """

with open("config-user.yml", "r") as ymlfile:
    confg = yaml.safe_load(ymlfile)
    
""" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MAIN %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% """

CI = ClimateImpact(input_dir, output_dir, **confg)
CI.calculate_accfs(**confg)
```
The output netCDF file is generated in: *climaccf/test/sample_data/env_processed.nc*. 

## How to compile documentation pdf

You can use the Makefile created by Sphinx to create your documentation. Locate yourself in the documentation path.

First clean the _build directory to avoid error or legacy information. Just call:

```bash
make clean
```

In case you want to build your documentation in latex call **twice**:

```bash
make latexpdf
```

if you want to do build your in html call:

```bash
make html
```

Note that you **should not see** any error or warning, this information appears as red text in the terminal.
